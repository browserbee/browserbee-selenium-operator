# Declarative Workflows

Declarative testing with the **BrowserBee Selenium Operator** lets you define browser workflows using Kubernetes-native YAML â€” based on the [Selenium Workflow Specification](https://browserbee.io/selenium-workflow-specification.json). This approach treats browser tests as infrastructure, making them versioned, composable, and automation-ready.

## What Is Declarative Selenium Workflow?

Declarative workflows is the practice of defining **what** to test (e.g., click this, assert that) in a structured way, instead of writing imperative test code in Python or Java. You express the desired workflow in a `SeleniumWorkflow` YAML Custom Resource, and the operator handles browser automation behind the scenes.

## Why Use Declarative Selenium Tests?

- **No test scripts required** â€” YAML does the work.
- **CI/CD and GitOps friendly** â€” version, diff, and review tests in pull requests.
- **Portable** â€” define tests once, run them on any Kubernetes cluster.
- **Reusable patterns** â€” easily compose common UI flows.
