# 📚 Documentation

Get the answers you need with Selenium Operator documentation.

Welcome to the Selenium Operator documentation! This site provides comprehensive guides and resources to help you deploy, manage, and automate browser testing using Selenium on Kubernetes. Whether you're just getting started or you're running complex test grids in production, this documentation has everything you need.

Selenium Operator simplifies Kubernetes-native browser automation using a set of Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and an Operator pattern:

- **Selenium Operator** manages the full lifecycle of Selenium Grids, including deployment, upgrades, and autoscaling.
- **SeleniumGrid CR** defines how your Selenium hub(s) and Selenium node(s) should be deployed and connected.
- **SeleniumHub CR** defines how your Selenium hub(s) should be deployed and connected.
- **SeleniumNode CR** defines how your Selenium node(s) should be deployed and connected.

Explore the guides below, or jump directly to the **Overview** for a complete introduction to the operator and its core features.
